tmux-stare
----------

stare (Ukrainian /stɐˈrɛ/ for "something old") - yet another session manager for tmux.

This plugin was heavily inspired by tmux-continuum and tmux-resurrect, but
I didn't like that they loaded all previous sessions. I wanted a way to
load sessions selectively, so I made this plugin.

FEATURES
- Automatic saving of sessions
- Selective session recerrect
- Picker for interacting with your sessions

INSTALLATION

    # with tpm
    set -g @plugin 'olexsmir/tmux-stare'
    set -g @stare-pick 'o'

REQUIREMENTS
- tmux (tested on 3.6a)
- fzf (tested on 0.67.0)

OPTIONS

    # Bind for opening picker to select and restore sessions.
    # Default: '' (not set)
    set -g @stare-pick 'o'

    # Bind for manually triggering save of all sessions.
    # Default: 'C-s'
    set -g @stare-save 'C-s'

    # Start action. 'pick' opens picker on start, 'last' restores last session
    # Default: ''

FUTURE

    Things I might add in the future.

    - Resurrect of vim with ':mksession'
    - Keep content of panes
